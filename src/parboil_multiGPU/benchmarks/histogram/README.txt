Multi-GPU histogram implementation
---------------------------------

Histogram kernel is bandwidth limited and speedup can be achieved by multiple GPUs.

In the multi-GPU version sample points are equally split across the GPUs and both the GPUs
generate their own sub-histograms. The sub-histograms generated by the GPUs is transferred back
to the host RAM and accumulated in the host to produce the final Histogram

This kernel is implemented for only 2 GPUs.

NOTE: The histogram code is taken from the Nvidia CUDA SDK and NOT from parboil
